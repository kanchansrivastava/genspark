q1. create a function work that takes a work id and print work {id} is going on
    In the main function run a loop to run work function 10 times
    make the work function call concurrent
    Make sure your program waits for work function to finish gracefully

q2. Follow up to the previous question
    Spin up one anonymous goroutine in the work function
    This goroutine prints some stuff on the screen and sleeps for 100ms
    Make sure you wait for every goroutine to finish and end everything gracefully


q3. Create 4 functions
    Add(int,int),Sub(int,int),Divide(int,int), CollectResults()
    Add,Sub,Divide do their operations and push value to an unbuffered channel

    CollectResult() -> It would receive the values from the channel and print it
