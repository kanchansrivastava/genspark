q1. Create a handler which accepts any kind of json and prints it
    check if client is still connected or not
    if client is connected then return json processed otherwise just move on

    Hint: use map[string]any if not sure about json structure
    any type has a tradeoff as well, you can't access the fields directly,
    type assertion needs to be done every time

    TO find the JSON what user has sent, you can use r.Body

q2. Create a middleware which logs request url, request method and time to complete the request
    Hint: time package can help
