q1. Create a handler which accepts any kind of json and prints it
    check if client is still connected or not
    if client is connected then return json processed otherwise just move on

    Hint: use map[string]any if not sure about json structure
    any type has a tradeoff as well, you can't access the fields directly,
    type assertion needs to be done every time

    TO find the JSON what user has sent, you can use r.Body

q2. Create a middleware which logs request url, http request method and time to complete the request
    Hint: time package can help


q. Develop a REST API for a task management system.
   Use gin or chi
# Task Management APIs
   POST    /api/v1/tasks                 # Create a new task
   GET     /api/v1/tasks/:id             # Get a specific task by ID
   GET     /api/v1/tasks                 # Get all tasks (filter/sort optional)
   PUT     /api/v1/tasks/:id             # Update task details
   DELETE  /api/v1/tasks/:id             # Delete a task
   PATCH   /api/v1/tasks/:id/status      # Update task status (e.g., In Progress, Done)

   Store tasks in postgres
   Organize your code in different packages

   Try if you can achieve this
   - Decouple the handlers from actual implementation using interfaces
