q1. Write a Go program that:
    Creates an empty slice with an initial capacity of 1.
    Appends integers from 1 to 1,000,000 to the slice.
    Tracks and prints the capacity change every time the slice's capacity increases.
    Prints the total number of capacity changes at the end.

    Formula:= (currentCap-lastCap) / lastCap * 100
